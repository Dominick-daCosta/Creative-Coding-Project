# Creative-Coding-Project
Project from city university of lonon, atempting to visulaise data in a creative way. Inspired by the dear data 100 project

Code is to be run in the IDE Processing
Can be downloded at https://processing.org/download

Data being visullised is spotify music history, which was extrapolated into the different emotions each song has and then corilating that to the weather on that day.
Each line in the cirlcles is an induvidual song and the size of each circle corilates to the amount of songs for that weather

Yellow = Happy
Blue = Sad
Red = Sensual
